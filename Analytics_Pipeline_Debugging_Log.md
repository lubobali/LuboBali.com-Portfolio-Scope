---

## 6. DAILY AGGREGATION ERRORS

### Cron Job Setup Issues
- Scheduler service not starting properly
- Cron timing configuration errors
- UTC timezone conversion problems
- Daily aggregator script import failures
- Background process termination issues

### Data Processing Errors
- SQL aggregation query syntax errors
- Date range calculation inconsistencies
- Empty result set handling failures
- Memory overflow on large datasets
- Transaction deadlock during aggregation

---

## 7. DASHBOARD & VISUALIZATION ERRORS

### Streamlit Interface Issues
- Dashboard page loading failures

- Chart generation timeout issues
- Real-time data refresh problems
- CSS styling conflicts

### Data Display Problems
- Date filtering not working correctly
- Page analytics showing incorrect metrics
- Session analysis calculation errors
- Export functionality failures
- Mobile responsiveness issues

---

## 8. DUPLICATE PREVENTION ERRORS

### Request Deduplication Issues
- Same request being sent multiple times
- Request ID generation conflicts
- Set-based duplicate detection failing
- Race conditions in request processing
- Memory leaks from stored request IDs

### Event Timing Problems
- Exit events triggered on page arrival
- Premature event firing before page load
- Event listeners not being properly removed
- Multiple event handlers for same action
- Browser tab visibility detection errors

---

## 9. PRODUCTION TESTING ERRORS

### Live Environment Issues
- Incognito mode tracking failures
- Cross-browser compatibility problems
- Mobile device tracking inconsistencies
- Network connectivity handling errors
- Real user data validation issues

### Performance & Monitoring
- High memory usage in production
- Database connection pool exhaustion
- API response time degradation
- Log file size growing too large
- Error tracking and alerting gaps

---

## 10. FINAL BUG FIXES

### Critical Production Issues
- Two records being created per single click
- Premature exit event firing in initializePage()
- Exit listeners not being properly managed
- Duplicate request blocking not working correctly
- Session persistence across browser sessions

### Code Quality & Maintenance
- JavaScript code duplication across files
- Inconsistent error handling patterns
- Missing edge case validations
- Code comments and documentation gaps
- Version control and deployment workflow issues

---
